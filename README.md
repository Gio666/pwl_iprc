This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and movies for the following paper:

Park Y, Shaw KM, Chiel HJ, Thomas PJ. The Infinitesimal Phase Response Curves of Oscillators in Piecewise Smooth Dynamical Systems. Accepted to the Europeal Journal of Applied Mathematics 2018.

To generate the various figures from the paper, you will need to run the following commands:

`python generate_figures.py
`python pw_const.py

Some subfigures are generated independently. We used inkscape to put them together.
